# how to run gui app in raspberry pi on startup
I learned it from this blog: https://jsakov.medium.com/linux-start-an-application-automatically-at-boot-2b6fb61524d7.
Basically we need to edit following file:

/etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart

with content like this:

@/path/to/myapp
@/usr/bin/python /home/pi/example.py
@/usr/local/bin/electron /home/pi/electron_example.py

Notes:
1. Donâ€™t forget the @
2. Your commands should come before the @xscreensaver line.
